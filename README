BerkeleyDB/Lite version 1.10
============================

BerkeleyDB::Lite streamlines the use of BerkeleyDB.pm.  For example,
a single constructor acquires both the necessary env and db handles; and
methods wrap common cursor operations.

This installation will place all BerkeleyDB files under a single root.  
This root directory is defined as the 'rootdir' member of the @defaults 
structure.  This definition can be overridden in the constructors.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, edit line 25 of Lite.pm to specify an appropriate
root directory.

Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
